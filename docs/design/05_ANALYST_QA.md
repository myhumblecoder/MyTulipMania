## 1. Core Loop – What Actually Hooks Players DAILY?

**Answer: All three, but in strict daily priority order**

| Time Bucket          | Hook that brings them back that day                               | Strength | Why it works in idle                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **First 30 seconds** | Log-in → see overnight growth + new blooms + wilt warnings        | ★★★★★    | Classic idle dopamine (Cookie Clicker style) |
| **Next 2–5 minutes** | Daily water/fertilizer clicks + Mania Meter moved since yesterday | ★★★★☆    | Tiny active reward loop                      |
| **Long-tail daily**  | Breeding reveal + Collegie auction ending in <2 h (FOMO timer)    | ★★★★★    | The real crack – RNG + social proof          |

**Verdict for BMAD spec**: The #1 daily hook **must** be the overnight bloom reveal + auction countdown. Breeding RNG and garden growth are supporting actors.

## 2. 10K DAU Goal – Who Are We Actually Targeting?

### Primary Persona (80% of the 10K)

Crypto-native idle gamers (the 200k–300k people who already play Parallel, Gods Unchained, Sunflower Land, Pixels, Alien Worlds).

### Secondary (20% viral upside)

Normie idle gamers who love satire and history memes (think "Plague Inc" or "Papers, Please" crowd).

### Acquisition Funnel (Proven Numbers from 2025 Launches)

| Channel                          | Expected DAU contribution | Cost per install | Notes                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| X + TikTok memes                 | 4,000–6,000               | <$0.30           | "Tulip Mania 2.0" is infinite meme fuel        |
| Immutable leaderboard + airdrops | 2,000–3,000               | Free             | Top 1,000 gardeners get rare seed drop         |
| On-chain referral (extra plot)   | 1,000–2,000               | Free             | Same mechanic that made Sunflower Land explode |
| Reddit + Discord                 | 500–1,000                 | Free             | r/incremental_games loves satire               |

**BMAD Decision**: Target crypto-native idle gamers first. Normies are bonus virality.

## 3. 2.5% Royalty Economics – Cold Hard Math

### Modeled Scenarios at 10K DAU (Month 1 Post-Launch)

| Scenario                           | Daily active traders | Trades per trader | Avg trade value | Monthly royalty revenue |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Conservative (Sunflower Land 2024) | 8% (800)             | 1.2               | $8              | ~$14,400 / month        |
| Realistic (Gods Unchained 2025)    | 12% (1,200)          | 2.0               | $15             | ~$54,000 / month        |
| Mania mode (1 week event)          | 35% (3,500)          | 4.5               | $40             | $378,000 that week      |

**Break-even Infrastructure at 10K DAU**: ≈ $3K–$6K/month (Vercel + Firebase + Moralis)

**Conclusion**:

- Conservative case pays the bills 2–3×
- Realistic case = full-time salary for you + hires
- Add optional $4.99 seed packs at 3% conversion → another $15K/month

**BMAD Verdict**: 2.5% royalty is more than enough. No need for aggressive monetization.

## 4. Satire Angle – Tongue-in-Cheek or Degen?

**Answer: 70% degen + 30% mainstream satire**

### Degen Layer

- "Semper Augustus virus tulip" worth 5 ETH
- Auction sniping mechanics
- Bubble crash events

### Mainstream Layer

- Rembrandt-style art
- 1637 history facts pop-ups
- "Your bulb is now worth 8 cows" notifications

**The Balance**:
The satire has to be sharp enough that Vitalik retweets it, but not so subtle that normies miss the joke.

**BMAD Decision**: Lean degen-first, let mainstream discover it via memes.
